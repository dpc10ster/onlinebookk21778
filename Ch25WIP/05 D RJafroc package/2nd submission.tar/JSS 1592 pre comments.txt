From the editorial team:

o All software mentioned should have a proper citation in the reference list.

o Running the examples gives me the following error:
>
>> OutputReport(dataset = frocData, method = "DBMH", fom = "Wilcoxon",
> +ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ showWarnings = FALSE) # ERROR!
> Error in FigureOfMerit(dataset, fom) :
>Ê Cannot use Wilcoxon with FROC or ROI data
> Calls: OutputReport -> DBMHAnalysis -> FigureOfMerit

o There are many style issues, especially code and reference formatting. (See below)


Manuscript style comments:

o Please only introduce an abbreviation within the abstract if it is needed again within the abstract. Otherwise, please introduce it within the body of the manuscript.

o \section, \subsection, etc. should be in sentence style (see http://www.jstatsoft.org/style#q2), e.g., change Ò2. Statistical Models and MethodsÓ to Ò2. Statistical models and methodsÓ

o The code presented in the manuscript should not contain comments within the verbatim code. Instead the comments should be made in the normal LaTeX text.

o Code should be presented without additional background or coloring. 

o For the code layout in R publications, we use the command prompt ÒR>Ó and typically distinguish input/output using Sinput/Soutput (or equivalently CodeInput/CodeOutput). Unless there are special reasons to format it differently, the input should use the text width (up to 76 or 77 characters) and be indented by two spaces, e.g.,

begin{Sinput}
R> example_model <- lm(response ~ variable1 + variable2 + variable3, 
+    weights = w, data = mydata)
\end{Sinput}

o All captions should appear below the corresponding figure/table.

o All table row/column headers should also be in sentence style. 

o As a reminder, please make sure that:
	- \proglang, \pkg and \code have been used for highlighting throughout the paper (including titles and references), except where explicitly escaped.


References:

o The Annals of Mathematical Statistics (not: Annals of Mathematical Statistics)

o Springer-Verlag (not: Springer)

o As mentioned above, please make sure that all software packages are \cite{}'d properly.

o All references should be in title style.

o See FAQ for specific reference instructions.


Code:

o Please make sure that the files needed to replicate all code/examples within the manuscript are included in a standalone replication script.
