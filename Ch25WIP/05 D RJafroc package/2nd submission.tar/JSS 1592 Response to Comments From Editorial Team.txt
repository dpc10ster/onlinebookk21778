JSS 1592: Chakraborty, ZhaiAnalysis of Data Acquired Using ROC Paradigm and Its Extensions---------------------------------------------------------For further instruction on JSS style requirements please see the JSS style manual (in particular section 2.1 Style Checklist) at http://www.jstatsoft.org/downloads/JSSstyle.zipAlso see FAQ at: http://www.jstatsoft.org/styleFor further references please see RECENT JSS papers for detailed documentation and examples.---------------------------------------------------------From the editorial team:All software mentioned should have a proper citation in the reference list.Response: 
All software citations have been updated to comply with JSS style.Running the examples gives me the following error:>>> OutputReport(dataset = frocData, method = "DBMH", fom = "Wilcoxon",> +ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ showWarnings = FALSE) # ERROR!> Error in FigureOfMerit(dataset, fom) :>Ê Cannot use Wilcoxon with FROC or ROI data> Calls: OutputReport -> DBMHAnalysis -> FigureOfMeritResponseThe section on Generating an output report, in which this example occurs, has been completely rewritten to avoid the misunderstanding. The revised version of this section now reads:

The next example is deliberately included as an example of erroneous usage of the function. It will generate an error since the \code{fom} option set to \code{Wilcoxon} is incompatible with the FROC dataset (see Table~\ref{tab:terminology} for valid FOMs with FROC data). 

<<message=FALSE,eval=FALSE>>=
OutputReport(dataset = frocData, fom = "Wilcoxon",
  showWarnings = FALSE)
@
There are many style issues, especially code and reference formatting. (See below)Response
Thank you for noting them; they have been corrected.Manuscript style comments:Please only introduce an abbreviation within the abstract if it is needed again within the abstract. Otherwise, please introduce it within the body of the manuscript.Response
Done\section, \subsection, etc. should be in sentence style (see http://www.jstatsoft.org/style#q2), e.g., change Ò2. Statistical Models and MethodsÓ to Ò2. Statistical models and 
methodsÓResponse
DoneThe code presented in the manuscript should not contain comments within the verbatim code. Instead the comments should be made in the normal LaTeX text.Response
Done; all comments have been removed, and explanations have beed added in the sections immediately preceding the code examples.Code should be presented without additional background or coloring. Response
DoneFor the code layout in R publications, we use the command prompt ÒR>Ó and typically distinguish input/output using Sinput/Soutput (or equivalently CodeInput/CodeOutput). Unless there are special reasons to format it differently, the input should use the text width (up to 76 or 77 characters) and be indented by two spaces, e.g.,begin{Sinput}R> example_model <- lm(response ~ variable1 + variable2 + variable3, +    weights = w, data = mydata)\end{Sinput}Response
DoneAll captions should appear below the corresponding figure/table.Response
DoneAll table row/column headers should also be in sentence style. Response
DoneAs a reminder, please make sure that:	- \proglang, \pkg and \code have been used for highlighting throughout the paper (including titles and references), except where explicitly escaped.

Response
We have carefully checked this and believe it has been fully implemented.References:The Annals of Mathematical Statistics (not: Annals of Mathematical Statistics)Response
DoneSpringer-Verlag (not: Springer)Response
DoneAs mentioned above, please make sure that all software packages are \cite{}'d properly.Response
Done, to the best of our knowledge.All references should be in title style.Response
DoneSee FAQ for specific reference instructions.Response
DoneCode:Please make sure that the files needed to replicate all code/examples within the manuscript are included in a standalone replication script.

Response
Done; example data files that previously had to be downloaded from an external website have been moved to the package;the package is now fully self-contained.
