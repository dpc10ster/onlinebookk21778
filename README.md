# This is mostly superseded by the vignettes in RJafroc

See https://dpc10ster.github.io/RJafroc/

# Reason 

Due to `RJafroc` code updates, bug fixes, new features and improved code organization, etc., some of the code in this repository may not run with the latest version of `RJafroc`. It is more efficient for me to fix everything in one repository, namely `RJafroc`, than try to fix both `RJafroc` and the Online Appendix repositories.
