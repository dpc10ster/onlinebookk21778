# The Online Appendix is mostly superseded by the vignettes/articles in `RJafroc` at https://dpc10ster.github.io/RJafroc/


# Reason 

Due to extensive `RJafroc` code changes: bug fixes, new features and improved code organization, etc., some of the code in this repository may not run with the latest version of `RJafroc`. It is more efficient for me to fix everything in one repository, namely `RJafroc`, than try to fix both `RJafroc` and the Online Appendix repositories. I did not foresee this possibility when I wrote the book.
