# The Online Appendix is mostly superseded by the vignettes/articles in `RJafroc` at https://dpc10ster.github.io/RJafroc/

Due to extensive `RJafroc` code bug fixes, new features and improved code organization, etc., some of the code in this repository may not run with the latest version of `RJafroc`. I am in the process of converting most of the online appendix to `vignettes` or `articles` at https://dpc10ster.github.io/RJafroc/.
