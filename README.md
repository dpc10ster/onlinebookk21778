# This is mostly superseded by the vignettes in RJafroc

See https://dpc10ster.github.io/RJafroc/

# Reason 

Due to code updates, bug fixes, and new features and improved code organization, some of the online code in this repository may not run. It is more efficient for me to fix everything in the `RJafroc` repository that try to fix both `RJafroc` and the Online Appendix.
